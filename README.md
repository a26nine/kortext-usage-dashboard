## Visualisation
The primary question ‘What value does the book hold?’ can be answered specifically using the interactivity in this dashboard. The dashboard can be used in multiple ways to look at the value of books using different lenses. The interactivity of the dashboard allows the user to filter and specify selection as per their needs.
